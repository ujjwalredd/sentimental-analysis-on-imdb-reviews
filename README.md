# Sentimental Analysis on IMDB Reviews

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews. It aims to classify reviews as either positive or negative to determine the sentiment associated with each review. The sentiment analysis is performed using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ujjwalredd/sentimental-analysis-on-imdb-reviews.git`
2. Use the `.ipynb` file.

## Data
The dataset used for this project consists of IMDb movie reviews. You can find the [dataset here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).


## Analysis
The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and sentiment classification. The data is cleaned and tokenized, and features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization. A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed data to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Model
We use a Random Forest model for sentiment classification. The trained model is saved and can be used for making predictions on new data.

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Details of the evaluation can be found in the [.pynb file](https://github.com/ujjwalredd/sentimental-analysis-on-imdb-reviews/blob/main/sentimental%20analysis.ipynb).
